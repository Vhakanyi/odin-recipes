        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <strong>kota</strong> sandwich has its roots in the townships of South Africa, particularly in places like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto" target="_blank">Soweto</a> It emerged as a popular street food option in these areas, known for its affordability and filling nature.</p>
        <p>The sandwich likely originated in the mid to late 20th century when ingredients like polony, viennas (sausages), and bread became readily available and affordable. Vendors in the townships began crafting these sandwiches using simple, inexpensive ingredients that could be easily sourced.</p>
        <p>Originally sold for a quarter of a loaf of bread, hence the name "kota" derived from "quarter," the sandwich quickly gained popularity among locals as a quick and satisfying meal option. Over time, the kota sandwich evolved, with vendors adding various fillings such as french fries, fried eggs, cheese, and condiments like atchar (spicy pickled vegetables).</p>
        <p>Today, the kota sandwich remains a beloved street food in South Africa, reflecting the culinary traditions and cultural influences of the townships. It has also gained recognition beyond its local origins, attracting food enthusiasts who appreciate its unique flavors and history.</p>
